                                    These images are images of nature that I found on an online site. This site is copy right free allowing me to pick any of the images that I wanted and use them in my own project. I liked how they were not found on the typical social media platforms such as Instagram or Facebook. Not many people use google to locate images on websites any more as social media has completley taken over. It is very important for people to still use these online sites as people have worked hard to create and maintain them.</p>

                            <p class="piccaption"> You can tell that these images are not as high quaility as those found on other social media platforms that have an app. I feel that the highest quaility photos are found on Instagram. Everytime I look at a photo on Instagram it appears to be crystal clear. Even when I screen shot it and upload it to my computer afterward the quaility still stays perfect. These images are not of terrible quality but it is also not the best quality that I have ever seen.</p>

                            <p class="piccaption">Lastly, this topic has been of great interest to me for a while now. I have always enjoyed taking pictures of nautre and once I found my true passion for social media I was able to combine the two. Freshman year when I started in the ischool I knew right away that I was drawn to all classes realting to social media. This topic is extremley relevant in todays world and important to be educated on. It has allowed me to explore and discover so many amazing photos of nautre.</p>

                            <div class="pbox">
                            <p class="opinion text-center"> I feel that using social media to display images of nature that one takes is a great idea. This allows them to keep all of their images in one place for a wide variety of people to see. As seen on the previous page are some of my favorite pictures of nature found on instagram. Using social media also allows people to view your images wihtout even having to know you. There is also a way to use a hashtag when posting on instagram and another great way to find these images is by simply searching the hashtag.  </p>
